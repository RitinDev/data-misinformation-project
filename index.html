            <p> NYUAD, Abu Dhabi — We spent the day thinking about what relevant data we could analyze. We had to decide what to 
             write soon, and were left scratching our heads because the possibilities seemed endless. After considering our 
             options, the most relevant was so critical we spent two years discussing its implications. A collection of 
             viruses known as Sars-CoV-2, or Covid-19, was responsible for a worldwide pandemic. In some way, this epidemic 
             affected every country, industry, and individual. And now that the epidemic is nearing its end, we can properly 
             evaluate the secondary components of this historical event, particularly those that no vaccine or medicine could 
             prevent.
            </p>
            
            <p>One of the most striking aspects of this pandemic was the simultaneous spread of both the disease and 
              misinformation about it. While the pandemic spread quickly over the world, misconceptions about it circulated 
              just as quickly on the internet. Countries with generally well-equipped health-care systems briefly collapsed 
              due to the inability to treat so many afflicted citizens. Despite seeing close relatives succumb to the disease, 
              many downplayed the matter and maintained themselves in isolated echo chambers.
            </p>
            
            <p>But how can blatantly wrong information be accepted as the truth? Fake news would have faded away if it was based 
              solely on fabricated stories, like other online conspiracies. Notwithstanding this, governments relied on 
              misinformation campaigns to steer their policy throughout the pandemic because they were so convincing and effective. 
              How did we get to this level? As all four of us come from countries heavily affected by the pandemic, we decided to 
              dig deeper into the issue of Covid-19 related misinformation. According to 
              <a href = “https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00006-y”>a study</a> on misinformation, six elements make fake 
              news especially attractive to the public:

            <h2>Why and when are fake news attractive?</h2>
            <p>
              According to the paper "The psychological drivers of misinformation belief and its
              resistance to correction", fake news rely on psychological factors to be popular, and 
              even after being dismissed, they still affect your decision-making process. The factors 
              that make fake news popular are the following:

                <p><strong>Intuitive thinking: </strong> Fake news are easy to digest and interpret, and they do not leave 
                  space for discussion or critical thinking.</p>

                <p><strong>Cognitive Failure: </strong> When we consume news, it is common to focus
                on the content rather than on the sources or implications. This includes forgetting
                that we already saw the news' retraction, which means that we use misninformation even
                after learning and agreeing that it is fake.</p>

                <p><strong>Illusory Truth: </strong> to make fake news more credible, 
                the reports should look familiar and repeated. After being drove to believe
                that the world agrees with the fact, it is much easier to embrace it. </p>

                <p><strong>Source Cues: </strong> Unlike fact-checked news, whose main sources are
                  organizations and specialists directly studying the matter, fake news appeal to 
                  popular authority figures or have no source at all, but they always create a us x 
                  them situation where everyone in your group seems to agree with the misinformation
                  and the enemy group is responsible for all the problems in the world, no matter what
                  this group is.

                <p><strong>Emotion: </strong> Our brain tends to easily remember emotional responses 
                rather than pure facts. Memories linked to strong emotions such as anger, euphory or
                gloom are harder to ignore. Misinformation sites purposedly weaponize this creating 
                fearmongering or mockery content with loose ties to reality. This way, fake news look
                more relevant and easy to recall.

                conspiracy theories. The brain rewards reading content that agrees with preconcieved 
                information since it means that you are aligned with you community's thoughts. For this 
                reason, msiinformation can be contradictory, but the conclusion will always appeal to your

              <h2>How to identify fake news?</h2>
            
            <p>Upon reading the paper, it became easier to understand how fake news could become so popular. Misinformation 
              manipulated the ego of millions, who accordingly acted recklessly, which allowed the virus to spread rapidly among 
              the populace. And, unfortunately, even after understanding that something is false, people frequently use that 
              knowledge to make decisions.
            </p>

            <p>A few days of work had passed. Government regulations kept getting relaxed as the numbers declined. We had a 
              direction to follow and we finally had a thesis. The question now was what to look for and how to find it? 
              Misinformation databases were easy to find because of the sheer volume of damaging content on the internet, 
              but computers do not excel at processing human language, let alone internet slang. Also, while factual news 
              commonly appears under articles and mainstream media sites, fake news tends to spread on social media. This 
              difference implies that they have different constraints even when there is no variation in content. If we were 
              not careful, we would poison the research before it even started. For this reason, we decided to invest time in 
              social media content, English-speaking Twitter specifically, as they are home to a large volume of misinformation 
              and fact-checked news trying to dominate the space.

              fact-checked news trying to dominate the space.
</p> 
              
            <p>Our initial problem was deciding which type of content to evaluate. We originally intended to examine long-form 
              English articles.The database we found had links to both real and fake news stories. While there were a number of 
              links to long-form pieces, many of those links were either defunct or linked to fact-checking websites that did 
              not provide links to the source material. After a bit more digging, we uncovered a thorough dataset compiled by 
              independent researchers for the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) to classify 
              tweets into true news and misinformation.We also filtered out English tweets from 
              <a href = “https://esoc.princeton.edu/publications/esoc-covid-19-misinformation-dataset”>Princeton’s ESOC COVID-19 Misinformation Dataset</a>, 
              used the Twitter API to scrape their text, and added them to the false news database. Now, we had over 3000 true 
              tweets and over 3000 false tweets to analyze.
            </p>
            
            <p>First, we wanted an overview of our datasets we looked at, so we looked at the most frequent words used. To dive 
              in deeper, we used a technique known as 
              <a href = “https://towardsdatascience.com/topic-modeling-and-latent-dirichlet-allocation-in-python-9bf156893c24”>LDA Topic Modelling</a>
              , that helped us discover the common broad topics the datasets seemed to cover.

            <p>We should expect those results, but it is interesting to see that computers can capture the nature of the pandemic. The content we scraped is related
              to a world pandemic. Whether you are unsatisfied with the millions of deaths or the limitations quarantine imposed on your lifestyle, sadness and 
              depression are understandable.
            </p>
            
            <p>Curiously, both tweet groups express similar feelings. Sometimes, the difference between fake and correct is hard to perceive. For this work,
              we consider fact-checking the leading tool to define what is misleading. As information is updated, recent or even checked data can become fake
              news if found to be wrong and later shared to mislead. No matter how well we choose our sources, we are bound to find fake news published as 
              reliable information. Outdated information may skew the differences since its goal is not to mislead when created, but it will still arise as
              fake after being fact-checked.

            </p>
            
            <p>
              Sentiments are hard to analyze with computers, no surprise at this point, but patterns are easy to be found. While trustworthy information will 
              focus on numerical data and its interpretation, successful fake news will direct the blame to the ones you love to hate, or ignore the disease 
              as a hoax created by this same group. Keywords are analyzed by searching the most common words in each database, and how different their frequency 
              is in each set. Intuitively, if you are familiar with extremist speeches, the differences in vocabulary and focus should be painfully easy to 
              imagine. Having this in mind, we verified if the data agreed with us.
            </p>
               
            <p>
              The next test that we used originates on a common idea: misinformation consumption appears associated with low levels of education. Although 
              misinformation may have less jargon to make it accessible to more people, education's link is more dubious. For this reason, we decided to test 
              this assumption. Some tools are used to evaluate how hard a text is to read, and we assume that misguided texts should be easier to read. 
              Specifically, the LIX index is a simple tool that investigates word and sentence length and assigns a value to a text without considering its 
              content. The overall length of the texts is also a good indicator of readability and we used it to compare true and fake news information content.
            </p>
            
            <p>The deadlines are coming, and everybody in our group had the unpleasant experience of facing enough fake news outside the class. As the lack of 
              sleep changes from apprehension to surviving a global disaster to spending time on homework, our concepts about fake news became more informed. We 
              used a few small tests to differentiate between fake and true news. Following Twitter's resources, the number of mentions (@), links, and emojis may 
              seem spurious data but contain a lot of information on how a topic is treated.
