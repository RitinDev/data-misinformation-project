             NYUAD, Abu Dhabi — I spent the rest of the day thinking about what relevant data we could analyze. The deadline was approaching, and with it, 
             other assignments that we had to spend time on. We had to decide what to write about so we could start working as soon as our schedules allowed. 
             But, in the end, the most relevant subject was so clear that the whole world spent two years discussing it. Sars-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19, 
             is a group of viruses that became the global pandemic we have faced since 2020. All countries, economic sectors, and all people got affected 
             somehow by this new scenario. And now that we are moving out of the pandemic, we can analyze better the secondary aspects of this recent historical 
             event, mainly the ones we could not solve with the vaccination drives.
            </p>
            
            <p>
             One of the most vital elements of this pandemic was the combined spread of the disease itself and misinformation. COVID-19 is not only especially 
             fitting for fast-spreading (highly contagious and with low lethality virus), but the internet was perfect for the propagation of the infodemic. 
             Countries with otherwise well-equipped health systems temporarily crumbled as they could not maintain the treatment of so many citizens. Yet, as 
             any opinion is available on the internet, people found content that agrees with them and kept themselves in isolated bubbles even after seeing 
             close relatives dying from the disease. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
             But how blatantly wrong information can be taken as the truth? If fake news involved merely baseless stories, it would have disappeared like most 
             internet conspiracies. However, misinformation campaigns were so decisive during the pandemic that governments used them to guide policies and deal 
             with the population. How did we get to this level? As all four of us came from countries heavily affected by the pandemic, we decided to dig deeper 
             into the matter. According to a study on misinformation, six elements make fake news especially attractive to the public:

            <h2>Why and when are fake news attractive?</h2>
            <p>
              According to the paper "The psychological drivers of misinformation belief and its
              resistance to correction", fake news rely on psychological factors to be popular, and 
              even after being dismissed, they still affect your decision-making process. The factors 
              that make fake news popular are the following:

                <p><strong>Cognitive Failure: </strong> When we consume news, it is common to focus
                on the content rather than on the sources or implications. This includes forgetting
                that we already saw the news' retraction, which means that we use misninformation even
                after learning and agreeing that it is fake.</p>

                fearmongering or mockery content with loose ties to reality. This way, fake news look
                more relevant and easy to recall.

            <h2>How to identify fake news?</h2>
            
            <p>After reading the paper, it was easier to understand how fake news can be so popular. Millions of people had their egos manipulated, 
              and millions died because of carelessness. Of course, the goal of studying the root causes of misinformation spreading is to fight 
              against it. But the paper itself reveals that even after acknowledging that the information is false, people will consider it for 
              decision-making. In other words, correcting fake content whenever it is released is not enough to stop it.
            </p>

            <p>Although this sad reality was quite disappointing, our newly formed group asked: what can we do? If fake content is hard to dissociate 
               from, we need to know how to identify misinformation to avoid it before it gets ingrained in our brains. Also, legitimate information 
              has not been as effective in fighting for space in popular beliefs. Both conclusions point in the same direction: fake news propagation 
              is fundamentally different from mainstream tested information, not only in content but also in the form,  in perceptible and imperceptible ways.
            </p>
            
            <p>A few days of work had passed. Government regulations kept getting relaxed as the numbers declined. We had a direction to follow. The questions 
              are now what should we look for and how to find it? Misinformation databases are easy to find, but computers do not excel at processing human 
              language, not even internet slang. Also, while factual news commonly appear under articles and mainstream media sites, fake news tend to spread 
              on social media. This difference implies that they have different constraints even when there is no variation in content. If we were not careful, 
              we would poison the research before it started. For this reason, we decided to invest time in social media content, English-speaking Twitter 
              specifically, as they are home to a large volume of misinformation and fact-checked news trying to dominate the space.
              
            </p> 
            <p>The first elements we looked for were fearmongering and enraging content. Manipulating feeling is an old tactic for social media, and Facebook 
              even revealed to engage users by making them angry in leaked papers. Whether you agree or not with the content, you will pay attention to it and 
              spread it to more people. It is a win-win situation for the publisher, and the only way to stop it is by using the old internet adage "do not 
              feed the trolls." But for us trying to identify fake content, this is also very useful. Some tools classify text according to its supposed emotional
              content. They work by assigning values to words according to content pre-classified by humans. The first tool we tested was sentiment analysis 
              algorithms, which seems like an oxymoron. The one we used to classify text between positive, negative, or neutral. We should then expect more negative
              content under the fake news database and more neutral tones in the truthful set. This is what we found:
            </p>
            
            <p>Tweets are short, with a limit of 280 characters. Although we found a pattern, shorter texts do not provide results as reliable as long articles. 
              Another class of algorithms also evaluates feelings, called Mood Analysis, but it is more sophisticated. Rather than classifying it as positive or 
              negative, it guesses what feeling it portrays. There are six classifications for the one we used: fatigue, vigor, confusion, tension, anger, and 
              depression.
            </p>
            
            <p>We should expect those results, but it is interesting to see that computers can capture the nature of the pandemic. The content we scraped is related
              to a world pandemic. Whether you are unsatisfied with the millions of deaths or the limitations quarantine imposed on your lifestyle, sadness and 
              depression are understandable.
            </p>
            
            <p>Curiously, both tweet groups express similar feelings. Sometimes, the difference between fake and correct is hard to perceive. For this work,
              we consider fact-checking the leading tool to define what is misleading. As information is updated, recent or even checked data can become fake
              news if found to be wrong and later shared to mislead. No matter how well we choose our sources, we are bound to find fake news published as 
              reliable information. Outdated information may skew the differences since its goal is not to mislead when created, but it will still arise as
              fake after being fact-checked.

            </p>
            
            <p>
              Sentiments are hard to analyze with computers, no surprise at this point, but patterns are easy to be found. While trustworthy information will 
              focus on numerical data and its interpretation, successful fake news will direct the blame to the ones you love to hate, or ignore the disease 
              as a hoax created by this same group. Keywords are analyzed by searching the most common words in each database, and how different their frequency 
              is in each set. Intuitively, if you are familiar with extremist speeches, the differences in vocabulary and focus should be painfully easy to 
              imagine. Having this in mind, we verified if the data agreed with us.
            </p>
               
            <p>
              The next test that we used originates on a common idea: misinformation consumption appears associated with low levels of education. Although 
              misinformation may have less jargon to make it accessible to more people, education's link is more dubious. For this reason, we decided to test 
              this assumption. Some tools are used to evaluate how hard a text is to read, and we assume that misguided texts should be easier to read. 
              Specifically, the LIX index is a simple tool that investigates word and sentence length and assigns a value to a text without considering its 
              content. The overall length of the texts is also a good indicator of readability and we used it to compare true and fake news information content.
            </p>
            
            <p>The deadlines are coming, and everybody in our group had the unpleasant experience of facing enough fake news outside the class. As the lack of 
              sleep changes from apprehension to surviving a global disaster to spending time on homework, our concepts about fake news became more informed. We 
              used a few small tests to differentiate between fake and true news. Following Twitter's resources, the number of mentions (@), links, and emojis may 
              seem spurious data but contain a lot of information on how a topic is treated.

                <p><strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see
                  a
                  similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar
                  cup
                  in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>

                <p><strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from
                  place
                  to place before
                  they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the
                  same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>

                <p><strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of
                  a
                  second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the
                  violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.

                <p><strong>FLUCTUATION</strong> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations
                  in
                  swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the
                  early
                  universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>

                <p><strong>EXPANSION</strong> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster
                  than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And
                  the
                  structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>
